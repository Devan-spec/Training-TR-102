Today, sir told about OSI model.
OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection. It has 7 layers Physical layer, Data Link layer, Network layer, Transport layer, Session layer, Presentation layer, and Application layer.
When we transfer information from one device to another, it travels through 7 layers of OSI model. First data travels down through 7 layers from the sender’s end and then climbs back 7 layers on the receiver’s end.

Data flows through the OSI model in a step-by-step process:
Application Layer: Applications create the data.
Presentation Layer: Data is formatted and encrypted.
Session Layer: Connections are established and managed.
Transport Layer: Data is broken into segments for reliable delivery.
Network Layer: Segments are packaged into packets and routed.
Data Link Layer: Packets are framed and sent to the next device.
Physical Layer: Frames are converted into bits and transmitted physically.
