Today, Sir told about encryption and decryption.
encryption is the conversion of Plain text to sypher text.
when we write a password, and sign up a web site for the first time, The password is stored in the form of hashes.
Hashes are that key which is not directly understood by the users or hackers.
we decrypt the Hashes and then these are understood by the users.
Hashes are irreversible. meaning, once done cann't be changed.
Encryption of data is of two types:- 
1) Symmetric text:- when only one peson has the key (eg. sender has the key to the password).
2) Assymetric text:- When both (sender and reciever) has the key to the password. It is most commonly used.
3rd person can't access the encrypted data.
