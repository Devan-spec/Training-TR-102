Today was the introduction of my institute. there are 3 labs in my institute. It was a nice experience as I was a noob in cyber security and I came with a passion that I will become a proffessional in cyber security
On the day, I met my teachers "Mr. faisal" and "Mr. Gobind" were appointed to teach us.
On this day, I did a new topics.
First one is 'basic linux commands'.
Basic linux commands include 'mkdir' command, 'cd' command, 'cat' command, 'cat >' command, 'rmdir' command, 'rm -r' command and much more.
It was a overall nice experience.
