Today was the introduction of my institute. there are 3 labs in my institute. It was a nice experience as I was a noob in cyber security and I came with a passion that I will become a proffessional in cyber security
On the day, I met my teachers "Mr. faisal" and "Mr. Gobind" were appointed to teach us.
On this day, I did install my Kali Linux in Oracle Virtual box.
It was a long process but was finally installed.
