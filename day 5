Today, i studied Linux commands.
LInux commands are of 5 types.
They are:- & commannd, && command, > command, >> command and grep command
& command is used for allowing commands in the background.
&& command is used for typing more than one command. For eg:- sudo update && sudo install
> command is used to write over files.
>> command is used when you want to write over a file and also secure some data in the file.
Grep command is used when we want to search one word from more than one word written in a file.
Nice experience
