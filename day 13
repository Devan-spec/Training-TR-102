Today, Sir told us about hashes
Hashes are those which are not understandable by users. They must be decrypted in order to get understood.

To decrypt them, we are known to do these things,
1) install Hash-identifier on your terminal by using command 'sudo apt-get install hash-identifier'.
2) type 'hash-identifier'.
3) Then type hash you want to search. Then, you will get which type of hash is it.
4) Type 'hashcat -h'. you will see a no. flashing in front of the hash type upon scrolling up the terminal machine.
5) At last type, type 'hashcat -m <the no.> <hash which u are searching', to decode the hash.

Sir told about cyberchef website where we can easily decode any hash.

Nice experience
