Today, sir told about brute force attack.
A brute force attack is a hacking method that uses trial and error to crack passwords, login credentials, and encryption keys. It is a simple yet reliable tactic for gaining unauthorized access to individual accounts and organizations' systems and network.

How to Use Hydra  to Hack Passwords – Penetration Testing Tutorial

Hydra is a brute-forcing tool that helps penetration testers and ethical hackers crack the passwords of network services.

Hydra can perform rapid dictionary attacks against more than 50 protocols. This includes telnet, FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, SMB, databases, and several other services.

Hydra is also a parallelized login cracker. This means you can have more than one connection in parallel. Unlike in sequential brute-forcing, this reduces the time required to crack a password.

How to Install Hydra
Hydra comes pre-installed with Kali Linux and Parrot OS. So if you are using one of them, you can start working with Hydra right away.

On Ubuntu, you can use the apt package manager to install it:
$ apt install hydra
In Mac, you can find Hydra under Homebrew:

$ brew install hydra
If you are using Windows, I would recommend using a virtual box and installing Linux. Personally, I don't recommend using Windows if you want to be a professional penetration tester.

How to Work with Hydra
Let’s look at how to work with Hydra. We will go through the common formats and options that Hydra provides for brute-forcing usernames and passwords. This includes single username/password attacks, password spraying, and dictionary attacks.
If you have installed Hydra, you can start with the help command like this:
Hydra help command
$ hydra -h
This will give you the list of flags and options that you can use as a reference when working with Hydra.

How to Perform a Single Username/Password Attack with Hydra
Let’s start with a simple attack. If we have the username and password that we expect a system to have, we can use Hydra to test it.
Here is the syntax:
$ hydra -l <username> -p <password> <server> <service>
Let’s assume we have a user named “molly” with a password of “butterfly” hosted at 10.10.137.76. Here is how we can use Hydra to test the credentials for SSH:
$ hydra -l molly -p butterfly 10.10.137.76
