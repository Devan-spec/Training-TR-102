Today, sir told about 'Methdology of hacking'
There are 5 steps to hack: -
1) Reconnaissance: -Goal is to collect as mich as information as possible.
2) Scanning: -Where attackers try to find weak points of the target and tries various ways to exploit those weaknesses.
3) Gaining Access: -Where attacker uses all means to get unauthorized access and enter in the system.
4) Maintaining Access: -Once the attacker manages to access the target system, they try their best to maintain access.
5) Covering Access: -Attackers leave no clue or evidence behind that could be traced.
