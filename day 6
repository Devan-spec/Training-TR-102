Today, Sir told us about mousepad.
mousepad is a text editor tool.
if you will put 'mousepad <file name> in our terminal, we will be redricted to another screen where we can edit the contents of the file.
Linux is case sensitive.
Meaning 'm'ousepad is the correct tool and 'M'ousepad is not a correct tool and will show error. This is because Linux is a case sensitive type.
Another good experience.
